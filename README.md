## Projects

### ML Claims Processing Pipeline
- Lead a team to build an end-to-end SageMaker ML pipeline to process America's medicare and medicaid claims using features engineered from ICD9, ICD10, CPT, HCPCS, RBCS, other healthcare code sets and part A and B claim characteristics.

### Member Risk and Opportunity Pipeline
- Created a Machine Learning model to predict the risk and opportunity of health insurance members for ACO populations with an accuracy of 98% saving a $1 million a year and bringing the predictions in-house.

### Special Reports on Member Trends
- Produced special reports on trends in our member population such as the effect of birth month on vaccination status in children. Presented findings to C-suite and VP level.
